                            ==> Attention MDCT <==

The puppet manifest for this server is located in */etc/puppetlabs/code*

If you intend to make changes under /etc/puppetlabs/code, please note 
you should not do so as root.  The appropriate ACLs are in place to allow 
team members to edit, commit, etc.  If you find yourself an exception to this, 
please contact Michael Watters for assistance.

If you wish to make changes beyond manifest/nodes.pp and modules/dart/,
please coordinate with Michael Watters first.

Please do not forget to commit your changes once tested and proven.  The
basics of this process are:

Review unstaged changes:
    $ git status
    $ git diff

Stage additions and removals so as to be ready to commit:
    $ git add -p file1 file2 dir3/
    $ git rm file3 file4

Review staged changes:
    $ git status
    $ git diff --cached

Commit staged changes (with final review):
    $ git commit -v

You may review these hints anytime via `cat /etc/motd'.  Thank You!
