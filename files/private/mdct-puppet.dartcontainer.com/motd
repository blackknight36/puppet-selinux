                            ==> Attention MDCT <==

If you intend to make changes under /etc/puppet, please note you should not
do so as root.  The appropriate ACLs are in place to allow team members to
edit, commit, etc.  If you find yourself an exception to this, please
contact John Florian for assistance.

If you wish to make changes beyond manifest/nodes.pp and modules/dart/,
please coordinate with John Florian first.

Please do not forget to commit your changes once tested and proven.  The
basics of this process are:

Review unstaged changes:
    $ git status
    $ git diff

Stage additions and removals so as to be ready to commit:
    $ git add -p file1 file2 dir3/
    $ git rm file3 file4

Review staged changes:
    $ git status
    $ git diff --cached

Commit staged changes (with final review):
    $ git commit -v

Thank You!
