# CONFIG_AREA is the directory where the "conf.d" resources can be found
# (under the AOS_TOP_DIR).  Prior to AOS 3.0, this was always just "conf.d",
# but 3.0 introduced a change that pegged these resouces to the AOS release
# number (e.g., "3.0-conf.d").

# CONFD is the directory containing configuration details for the AOS.  Also

# DEPOT is the directory in which AOS devices deposit their system state
# reports.

# CHECKSUM_DIRS is a space delimited list of conf.d type directories that are
# to be checksummed for efficient client node device pulls.  Typically, this
# would consist of only those conf.d directories for deployed AOS releases.
# Including conf.d directories for development AOS builds can make development
# and testing more difficult.
