# mirrmaid configuration
#
# See the Python documentation for ConfigParser for full details, but in
# general you assign values with either 'key: value' or 'key = value'.  Values
# may be continued on successive lines provided they begin with one or more
# whitespace characters.  Leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed. Because
# of the interpolation features of ConfigParser, any percent signs (%) that
# are to be taken as such, must be doubled (%%).


[MIRRMAID]

### Operations Summary Controls ###

# Since mirrmaid is not a daemon, it only runs as scheduled by cron (or other
# means).  Thus the operations summaries cannot be triggered and sent
# unless/until mirrmaid is actually running.  Keep this in mind when
# considering the following options.

# summary_recipients is a list of email addresses to whom the operations
# summaries should be sent.  If set, this must be a valid Python list.
#
# OPTIONAL; DEFAULT IS
summary_recipients: ["john.florian@dart.biz",]

# This option controls the minimum number of seconds that mirrmaid will wait
# after sending an operations summary via email before sending another.
# A minimum value of ten minutes is silently enforced.
#
# OPTIONAL; DEFAULT IS (24 hours)
#summary_interval: 86400

# If the size (in bytes) of the operations summary has exceeded the
# {summary_interval} threshold, the email will be sent early without
# necessarily waiting for the {summary_interval} to have elapsed.  This can be
# useful to alert the {summary_recipients} of major trouble in a more
# expedient way.  Set this to zero to defeat this feature.
#
# OPTIONAL; DEFAULT IS
#summary_size: 20000

# mirrmaid will keep {summary_history_count} historical copies of operational
# summaries on disk before they are rotated out of existence.  A minimum value
# of one is silently enforced.
#
# OPTIONAL; DEFAULT IS
#summary_history_count: 3

# If you have multiple mirrmaid configurations/jobs established on a single
# host, you may wish to keep the operations summaries distinct for each.  Each
# {summary_group} will result in a distinct operations summary and may be
# shared among any number of configurations/jobs.  The value of
# {summary_group} can be anything you wish.  It will be included in the email
# subject like so:
#       mirrmaid Activity Summary for {summary_group}
#
# OPTIONAL; DEFAULT IS
summary_group: YUM Fanout Mirrors (Plant-Local Mirrors of Master YUM Repos)
