# Synopsis:
#       This class is used primarily for servers that provided shared access
#       to media content used by the AOS media-playback devices.

class dart::abstract::plant_utility_server_node inherits dart::abstract::guarded_server_node {

    include 'autofs'

    class { 'puppet::client':
    }

    # AOS devices pull media-playback content using rsync.
    include rsync-server

    # That same media-playback content is pushed in via Windows systems.
    include samba

    # Additional content comes in the form of MDC's weather imagery.  The
    # media-disbursal module knows how to retrieve that imagery and merge it
    # with the content from the Windows system and disburse all such content
    # in a location where media-playback clients can utilize it.
