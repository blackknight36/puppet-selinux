# TODO:
#       Rather than inheriting from dart::abstract::est_server_node, this
#       should probably inherit dart::abstract::guarded_server_node instead as
#       it likely only needs postgresql postgresql-server and
#       postgresql-contrib with an est user created in postgres, not tomcat
#       and open ports in the 8000-range like the production EST system(s).
#
#       A good time to tackle such a change would be during the next rebuild
#       of this host, if ever.
