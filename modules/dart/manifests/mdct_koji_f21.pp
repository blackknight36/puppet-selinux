#
# == Class: dart::mdct_koji_f21
#
# Manages a Dart host as a Koji server.
#
# The host will be managed to provide:
#
#   - A dedicated SSL Certificate Authority (CA) for X509 certificates
#
#       /etc/pki/Koji/ contains an OpenSSL CA and one or more certificates
#       that Koji uses to authenticate its various components: koji-hub,
#       koijid, koji-web, koji-client and kojira.  It also contains a shell
#       script to create/revoke those certificates as well as additional
#       certificates for general user authentication.  Most of the initial CA
#       setup is handled by koji::ca.
#
#       Some services (e.g., httpd) will fail to start until certificates for
#       the following have been created:
#
#           - Koji-Web
#           - Koji-Hub
#           - Kojira
#
#       You will also want to create a user certificate for the Koji
#       administrator and most likely yourself too.
#
#   - Koji administrator account
#
#       The local user "kojiadmin" will be created.  This user's home
#       directory is populated with, at least:
#           - (renamed) copies of certificate files in ~kojiadmin/.koji
#
#   - PostgreSQL database
#
#       Initial database creation, schema importation and Koji administrator
#       account are performed automatically.  See Class[koji::database] for
#       details regarding upgrade procedures.
#
#   - Koji-Hub
#
#       Koji-Hub is the center of all Koji operations.  It is an XML-RPC
#       server running under mod_wsgi in the Apache httpd.  Koji-Hub is
#       passive in that it only receives XML-RPC calls and relies upon the
#       build daemons (kojid) and other components to initiate communication.
#       Koji-Hub is the only component that has direct access to the
#       PostgreSQL database and is one of the two components that have write
#       access to the file system.
#
#   - Koji CLI
#
#       The Koji command-line interface is the standard client.  It can
#       perform most tasks and is essential to the successful use of any Koji
#       environment.
#
#   - Koji-Web
#
#       A web interface for the masses, this is a set of scripts that run in
#       mod_wsgi and use the Cheetah templating engine to provide a web
#       interface to Koji.  Koji-Web exposes a lot of information and also
#       provides a means for certain operations, such as cancelling builds.
#
#   - Kojira
#
#       This daemon handles Yum repository creation and maintenance.
#
# Once you've successully gotten Puppet to build your Koji server, you will
# need to continue by bootstrapping the Koji build environment as discussed
# here:
#       https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Koji/ServerBootstrap
#
# === See Also
#
#   The entire "koji" Puppet module upon which this class so heavily depends
#   is built in accordance with the documentation available at:
