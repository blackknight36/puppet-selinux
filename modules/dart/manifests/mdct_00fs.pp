# modules/dart/manifests/mdct_00fs.pp
#
# == Class: dart::mdct_00fs
#
# Manages the MDCT/PMES file server.
#
# === Parameters
#
# ==== Required
#
# ==== Optional
#
# === Notes
#   This host was already deployed with critical configuration changes, most
#   of which were applied without the use of any CMS such as Puppet.  To
#   prevent adverse effects much of this class is effectively disabled, except
#   any changes to be applied since inception of this class.  Future builds of
#   this host would ideally leverage much more use of a CMS.
#
#   In the meantime, the comment tag "#@#" indicates where this class could
#   have applied certain resources (likely through inheritance), but were
#   defeated for reasons stated above.  They're kept here as a reminder or so
#   that they may be selectively enabled with extreme care.  In such a case,
#   it would be very wise to diff against the base classes (or other correct
#   origin) to ensure current practices are followed as things here are quite
#   likely stale to some extent.
