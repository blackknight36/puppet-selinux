#
# Synopsis:
#       Installs a single, specific JetBrains TeamCity release Build Agent.
#
# Parameters:
#       Name__________  Notes_  Description___________________________
#
#       name                    instance name
#
#       build                   TeamCity build ID, e.g. '3.0.8'
#
#       ensure          1       instance is to be present/absent
#
#       active          2       instance is to be enabled/running
#
#       server_url      3       URL were TeamCity Server may be reached
#
# Notes:
#
#       1. Default is 'present'.
#
#       2. Default is true.
#
#       3. Default is 'http://localhost:8111/', which is only appropriate for
#       the "bundled" authorized Agent that "comes with" the Server.  The
#       TeamCity package has both Agent and Server bundled together for the
#       Server installation, but the Puppet manifests isolate the two for
#       better modularity whilst still allowing the typical integrated setup
#       of the Server.
