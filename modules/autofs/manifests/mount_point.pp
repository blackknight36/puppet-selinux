# modules/autofs/manifests/mount_point.pp
#
# == Define: autofs::mount_point
#
# Configure a mount point for the autofs auto-mounter.  Each
# autofs::mount_point instance requires one or more autofs::map_entry
# instances as well since, at this time, only indirect mounts are supported by
# this puppet module.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*namevar*]
#   An arbitrary identifier for the mount point unless the "mount" parameter
#   is not set in which case this must provide the value normally set with
#   the "mount" parameter.
#
# [*mount*]
#   The directory name that is to serve as the mount point.  This directory
#   need not exist as the autofs service will create it, if necessary.  If the
#   directory does exist, any files contained there prior to activating the
#   mount will be inaccessible upon activation.  They will not be permanently
#   lost, just inaccessible for the duration of the mount.
#
# [*options*]
#   An optional space-separated list.  Items without leading dashes (-) are
#   taken as options (-o) to mount(8). Arguments with leading dashes are
#   considered options for the maps associated with this mount point.
