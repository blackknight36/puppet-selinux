# root cannot access user's home when mounted via NFS and root_squash, so
# might as well set HOME to something useful.
#
## However, mdct-dev12 is configured for no_root_squash, so it makes more sense to use the defaults in the main
## /etc/sudoers file regarding always_set_home and env_keep += "HOME".
## Defaults    always_set_home

# Allow all members of Dart's sudoers group (in LDAP) to run all commands.
%sudoers	ALL=(ALL)	ALL

# Provide a longer working time before expiring credentials.
Defaults    timestamp_timeout = 180

# Preserve the preferred EDITOR and prophile-related variables.
Defaults    env_keep += "EDITOR VIMINIT GVIMINIT PROPHILE"
