# root cannot access user's home when mounted via NFS and root_squash, so
# might as well set HOME to something useful.
#
## However, mdct-dev12 is configured for no_root_squash, so it makes more sense to use the defaults in the main
## /etc/sudoers file regarding always_set_home and env_keep += "HOME".
## Defaults    always_set_home
