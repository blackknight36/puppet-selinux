# root cannot access user's home when mounted via NFS and root_squash, so
# might as well set HOME to something useful.
#
# However, mdct-dev12 is configured for no_root_squash, so it makes more sense
# to use the defaults in the main /etc/sudoers file regarding lways_set_home
# and env_keep += "HOME".
#
# Defaults    always_set_home
