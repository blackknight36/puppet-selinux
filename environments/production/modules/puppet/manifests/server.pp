#
# == Class: puppet::server
#
# Configures a host as a puppet server.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*enable*]
#   This option is only honored when "use_passenger" is false.
#
#   If true (default), the puppet master service will be enabled for automatic
#   startup during system boot.  Otherwise the master service will not be
#   started automatically.
#
# [*ensure*]
#   This option is only honored when "use_passenger" is false.
#
#   If 'running' (default), the puppet master service will be started
#   immediately, if it is not already running.  Other valid values are:
#   'stopped', false (same as 'stopped') and true (same as 'running').
#
# [*use_passenger*]
#   If true (default), the puppet master will serve TCP port 8140 (the
#   standard) using Apache httpd via the Phusion Passenger rack server.
#   Otherwise, the port will be served using Ruby's own Webrick server which
#   is only suitable for small scale deployments and/or testing.
#
# [*cert_name*]
#   This must match the 'certname' setting in /etc/puppet/puppet.conf in the
#   [master] section on the puppet master.
#
# [*use_puppetdb*]
#  If true, the puppet master will use puppetdb to store facts and reports.
#  The default value is false.
