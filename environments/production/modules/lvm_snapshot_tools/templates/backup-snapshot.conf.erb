# Author:	John Florian <john_florian@dart.biz>


# ORIGIN_VGS is a space-delimited list of the VG (Volume Group) names where
# the snapshots are to be taken.  The backup-snapshot tool will attempt to
# snapshot all active, non-swap LVs (Logical Volumes) associated with these
# VGs.
ORIGIN_VGS='<%= @origin_vgs.flatten.join(' ') %>'

# Each VG must have sufficient free PEs (Physical Extents) for the creation of
# the snapshots.  All free PEs for the VG will be equally apportioned for each
# of the snapshot LVs.  If the calculated snapshot size would have fewer than
# MIN_SNAPSHOT_SIZE PEs, the backup-snapshot process will abort with an error.
MIN_SNAPSHOT_SIZE=<%= @min_snapshot_size %>

# SNAPSHOT_PREFIX is the name prefix to be given to each of the snapshot
# Logical Volumes.  The actual LV name will be "SNAPSHOT_PREFIX-#" (e.g.,
# "backup_snapshot_0", "backup_snapshot_1", and so on).  The name should be
# unique and not conflict with other LV names (within their respective VGs)
# that may exist on the system.
SNAPSHOT_PREFIX='<%= @snapshot_prefix %>'

# SNAPSHOTS_ROOT is the directory where all snapshot LVs will be mounted.  It
# is the one and only directory that should be backed up (recursively, of
# course).  The default value has been chosen to be unlikely to conflict with
# autofs which may "own" the more conventional /mnt directory.
SNAPSHOTS_ROOT='<%= @snapshots_root %>'
